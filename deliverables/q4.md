# Q4: Classification and Policy Implications

## 1. Introduction

In this task, I created a labeled dataset for a binary classification problem. The process of creating this dataset is detailed in the last section of the [q1.ipynb](../q1.ipynb) notebook. I calculated the percentage change in CO2 emissions from 2005 to 2015 for each country. Countries with a percentage change lower than -10% were labeled as successful cases of significant CO2 emissions reduction. This dataset was then used to train a classification model to predict whether a country will significantly reduce its CO2 emissions.

## 2. Classifier Performance

The classifier was trained to predict whether a country is likely to achieve a significant reduction in CO2 emissions in the next decade. The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 1.0
- **Precision**: 1.0
- **Recall**: 1.0
- **F1 Score**: 1.0

These perfect scores across all metrics indicate that the model perfectly classified both the positive and negative classes in the dataset. Such results are unusually high and warrant further investigation to rule out potential issues such as data leakage, overfitting, or other biases.

In this particular case, the lack of data, due to using only OECD countries, as well as the choice of years for calculating percentage change and the threshold for significant reduction, could impact the dataset and model performance. Further investigation is required, but due to time constraints, this will be addressed later.

## 3. Key Features Driving the Classification

The feature importance analysis identified the following key drivers of successful CO2 emission reduction:

- **Renewable Electricity Output (ren_elec_out)**: This feature was the most important factor in the model, suggesting that countries with higher outputs of renewable electricity are more likely to reduce CO2 emissions.

## 4. Policy Implications

Based on the modelâ€™s analysis, the following policy recommendations can be made for countries aiming to reduce their CO2 emissions:

- **Promote Renewable Energy**: Countries should focus on increasing their renewable electricity output. This can be achieved by investing in solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. Policies that incentivize renewable energy production and reduce reliance on fossil fuels are crucial.

Although it might seem obvious, the unusual performance of the model and the lack of feature engineering make it difficult to determine how other features contribute to CO2 emission reduction.

## 5. Discussion on Unusually High Performance Metrics

The following potential issues need to be addressed in the future to improve the model's performance:

1. **Data Leakage**

2. **Overfitting**

3. **Simplified Data**
